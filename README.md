# GBA_MiSTer
GBA for MiSTer

# HW Requirements/Features
The games can run from a naked DE10-Nano with the build-in DDR-RAM.
However, using SDRAM is highly recommended, as some games may slowdown or loose sync when using DDR-RAM.

When using SDRAM, it requires 32MB SDRAM for games less than 32MB. 32MB games require either 64MB or 128MB module.
SDRAM will be automatically used when available.

# Bios
Opensource Bios from Normmatt is included, however it has issues with some games.
Original GBA BIOS can be placed to GBA folder with name boot.rom

PLEASE do not report errors without testing with the original BIOS

# Games with crashes/hang

There is great testsuite you can get from here: https://github.com/mgba-emu/suite
It tests out correct Memory, Timer, DMA, CPU, BIOS behavior and also instruction timing. It works 100% on the real GBA.
The suite itself has several thousand single tests. Here is a comparison with mGBA, VBA-M and Higan

Testname | TestCount | Mister GBA| mGBA | VBA-M | Higan
